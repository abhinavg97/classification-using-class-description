CrisisNLP Word2vec Model (V1.2)
-----------------------------

DESCRIPTION:
------------
The trained model consists of a vocabulary with size 7976291 (~7 million) and 300 dimensional vector. 


HOW TO USE IT:
--------------
For example to find the top ten most similar words to the word "shelter", use the following python code:

***
from gensim.models import word2vec
model = word2vec.Word2Vec.load_word2vec_format('crisisNLP_word_vector.bin', binary=True)
words=model.most_similar(positive=['shelter'], negative=[], topn=10)

for w in words:
  print w[0]
# Few examples of most similar words
needs
somewhere
safe
needing
gurdwara
opened
give
stranded
offering
temple

#Finding the word vector
vector = model['shelter']
***
